# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to replace faulty data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School and gather data on how student performance is affected by various factors including school size, school type, and spending per student. Student performance was calculated by finding the average math score, the average reading score, the percentage of students passing each subject, and the overall percentage of students passing.

## Results

• Replacing the ninth graders results has no effect on the district summary because Thomas high School is a charter school.

• Although Thomas High School's percentage of students passing increases slight, due to the large samply size, school summary does not change much

• Due to the large sample size, replacing the ninth-grade scores does not change Thomas High School's standing in comparison to other schools. (see above)
• Because Thomas High School is a medium-sized charter school with $630-644 per student spending, replacing ninth-grade scores produced the following results:

## Summary

Because the math and reading scores for the ninth-graders at Thomas High School was removed, the number of students for THS and for the entire sample size was decreased. As a result of this, the data for all categories shifted. However, because the amount of students removed from the sample size was so small compared to the total amount, we can assume that there was no dramatic change in the data.
